    <p>Hey there.</p>
    <p>I'm the creator of this Hour of Code website, and I go by the online persona of JBM (or JBMagination).</p>
    <p>I decided to make this website because I've seen so many Hour of Code websites, and a lot of the time, they offer fake information.</p>
    <p>If you've used an Hour of Code website with blocks, it probably told you "oh look, this is JavaScript!" But, it's really not.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, it probably said "oh look, this is HTML5! This is JavaScript! This is CSS!" Once again, most of the time, that's not true.</p>
    <p>Now don't get me wrong, I love these places. It's fun to try them.</p>
    <p>But it's not going to be a cup of tea that's desired for those who want to try real code.</p>
    <p>And that's what this course is designed to offer.</p>
