      <h1 align="center">Hour of Code</h1>
      <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
      </br>
      <p>Hi there! I'm the creator of this website. I go online as JBMagination, but most call me JBM.</p>
      <p>You've probably seen the many Hour of Code websites out there. Unfortunately, most of the "code" that it writes is all fake.</p>
      <p>That HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you write with? It's probably not real. Using blocks? The "JavaScript" it gives back is also not real.</p>
      <p>And sure, that could make things much easier to write, but I always wanted to write real code when using those code websites.<p>
      <p>And that's why I created this. To give newcomers an easy way to learn basic code.</p>
      <p>If you truly want to get deep into learning how to code, here's some advice.</p>
      </br>
      <noscript><b>Enable JavaScript, goodness!</b></noscript>
      <noscript><p>It's not too late to come join NetScape... in all seriousness, enable JavaScript or go home.</p></noscript>
      <noscript></br></noscript>
      <b>Don't be afraid to look stuff up</b>
      <p>While you should never use copy and paste, you should definitely look stuff up if you have to. Most people who code do it all the time!</p>
      <p>You should always try to do it yourself first before searching, however. If you feel truly stuck, you should definitely search.</p>
      </br>
      <b>Take breaks if you need to</b>
      <p>It's never healthy to look at the screen for too long. Make sure that you take a break every once in a while, at least every few hours.</p>
      <p>While it can be fun to code, always prioritize your health first.</p>
      </br>
      <b>Coding is <i>not</i> the new literacy</b>
      <p>Coding is not an essential part of your life. Many make great heaps of money from coding, but you shouldn't feel forced to learn it.</p>
      <p>There is a difference between literacy and <i>code</i> literacy.</p>
      </br>
      <b>Know the differences between computer <i>science</i> and computer <i>programming</i></b>
      <p>While computer programming and computer science are closely tied together, there is a big difference between them.</p>
      <p>Computer programming is a subset of computer science, and is largely focused on, well, creating and utilizing code to make programs.</p>
      <p>Computer science, on the other hand, is largely focused on studying data and data interaction, alongside the design of computers.</p>
      <p>Consider Peter Norvig as a computer scientist. He studies in the field of artificial intelligence and is the directory of research at Google.</p>
      <p>Consider Jeff Atwood as a computer programmer. He created the developer platform Stack Exchange, but he didn't really have to study many fields to be considered a programmer.</p>
      </br>
      <b>There are plenty of sources out there</b>
      <p>If this sort of work doesn't fit your boat, I recommend <a href="https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>.</p>
      <p>They offer different courses than I do, but most of what you'll want to know is also offered both here and there, so go give them a visit if this doesn't seem to work out for you.</p>
      </br>
      <p>See you on the other side!</p>
